## 4. Testing Framework and Usage Rules

### 4.1. Test Framework

- **Primary Test Runner:**  
  Use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the default test runner for all unit, integration, and component tests.
- **Component Testing:**  
  Use `@testing-library/svelte` for Svelte component tests, and run these tests in a `jsdom` environment.
- **Mocking:**  
  Use `vi.fn()` and `vi.spyOn()` for all mocking and spying needs. Do not use legacy Jest APIs.
- **Test File Naming:**  
  Test files must be named with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix and placed alongside the code under test or in a `__tests__` directory.

### 4.2. Centralized Test Utilities & Mocks

- **Framework/Browser Polyfills:**  
  All framework or browser-specific polyfills (e.g., `window.matchMedia`, SvelteKit internals needed for jsdom) must be defined in `vitest-setup-client.ts` at the project root.  
  These are only for making the test runner environment compatible with your app/framework.

- **Business Logic & Global Mocks:**  
  All project-wide or business logic mocks (e.g., `createMockPrisma`, global Prisma mocking, API client mocks) must be defined in `test/setupTests.ts`.  
  This file is for global test setup and mocks that apply to all tests.

- **Test-Specific Utilities:**  
  Any test-specific types or helpers (like `CartRepositoryTestable`) should be defined directly in the test file that uses them, unless they are reused across multiple test files.

- **Usage:**  
  Import framework polyfills only if you need to extend them.  
  Import business logic mocks from `test/setupTests.ts` if you need to use or extend them in your test files.

- **No Redefinition:**  
  Do not redefine global mocks or polyfills in individual test files. Always import from the appropriate central file.

### 4.3. Test Structure and Best Practices

- **Setup:**  
  Use `beforeEach` to reset mocks and set up test state.  
  Assign central mocks and repository test doubles in this block.
- **Isolation:**  
  Each test must be independent; do not rely on state from previous tests.
- **Assertions:**  
  Use `expect()` from Vitest for all assertions.
- **Coverage:**  
  Strive for 100% coverage on business logic and critical e-commerce flows (cart, checkout, product selection, etc.).

### 4.4. Running Tests

- **Default Command:**  
  Run all tests using:
  ```sh
  npx vitest run --environment jsdom
  ```
- **Watch Mode:**  
  For development, use:
  ```sh
  npx vitest
  ```
- **Component Tests:**  
  Ensure Svelte component tests specify or inherit the `jsdom` environment.

### 4.5. Test Data and Fixtures

- **Test Data:**  
  Store reusable test data in `test-utils.ts` or a `fixtures/` directory.
- **No Hardcoding:**  
  Do not hardcode IDs or sensitive information in test files.

### 4.6. Linting and Formatting

- **Linting:**  
  All test files must pass `eslint` and `prettier` checks before merging.
- **Rule Enforcement:**  
  Any deviation from these rules must be documented and justified in the test file header.

---

**Rule:**

> All contributors must follow these testing framework and usage guidelines to ensure maintainability, consistency, and reliability across the codebase.

- Ensure all user-visible text is properly internationalized using Paraglide.
- Help manage translations in the en.json master file and maintain translation keys.
- Support implementation of language switching and language-specific content.
- Use import syntax to access translation messages rather than directly using $t() function.
- Make changes only to the en.json file, never modify the generated .js files.
- Respect the existing translation key structure and naming conventions.

### 4. Database Management with PRISMA ORM

- Use prisma/schema.prisma as the single source of truth for the PostgreSQL database schema.
- Generate type-safe Prisma ORM queries and validate against the defined schema.
- Assist with database migrations and schema evolution while maintaining referential integrity.
- Ensure proper implementation of relations between tables (products, variants, carts, users).

### 5. UI Enhancement

- Support implementation of responsive designs using Tailwind CSS v4.
- Assist with accessibility improvements and semantic HTML structure.
- Help integrate skeleton loading states for improved perceived performance.
- Ensure proper implementation of toast notifications for user feedback.

### 6. Data Flow Architecture

- Enforce a strict repository pattern where repositories are the only access point to the database.
- Ensure repositories always return viewmodels (DTOs) rather than direct database entities.
- Data should flow from repositories through server load functions to page components.
- Never access the database directly from components outside of repositories.
- Maintain clear separation between data access layer and presentation layer.
- Do not implement any API endpoints beyond those explicitly specified in requirements.

## Key Project Files and Components

### Database Structure (prisma/schema.prisma)

Parse prisma/schema.prisma to understand:

- Product, product variant, and product image schemas
- User and authentication tables
- Cart and cart item structures
- Order processing tables
- Discount and promotion schemas

Use this information to:

- Generate type-safe Prisma ORM queries
- Ensure proper table relations are maintained
- Validate data integrity constraints

### Internationalization (src/messages/en.json)

- Maintain awareness of translation keys defined in the master en.json file.
- Suggest new translation keys for any hardcoded text.
- Ensure proper import and usage of message functions in components.
- Help manage translation files for supported languages (en, de, fr, cn).
- Only modify the en.json file, never touch the generated .js files.

### Component Structure

- Support the implementation of reusable UI components in src/lib/components/ui/.
- Help maintain consistent usage of skeleton loading states for images and content.
- Assist with toast notification implementation for user feedback.
- Support proper implementation of cart functionality with optimistic UI updates.

### Repository Structure

- All database access should be through repositories in src/lib/repositories/.
- Repositories should return viewmodels (DTOs) from src/lib/models/ to decouple database schema from UI.
- Implement proper error handling and validation within repositories.
- Group related operations within specific repositories (e.g., ProductRepository, CartRepository).
- Ensure repositories expose consistent, well-typed methods for data operations.

## Operating Principles

### Svelte 5 Best Practices

- Always use runes ($state, $derived, $effect) instead of traditional reactivity.
- Use snippet-based component composition with {@render children()} syntax.
- Avoid deprecated slot-based approaches in favor of snippet-based patterns.
- Implement appropriate event handling with the new property-based syntax.

### SvelteKit 2 Architecture

- Support file-based routing in the src/routes/ directory.
- Help implement server-side load functions for data fetching.
- Ensure proper error handling with +error.svelte pages.
- Maintain efficient client-side navigation with prefetching.

### Performance Optimization

- Prioritize SSR and SSG capabilities for optimal loading performance.
- Implement code splitting through dynamic imports.
- Support proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Help minimize client-side JavaScript for better Core Web Vitals.

### Accessibility and User Experience

- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Svelte components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Support keyboard navigation for interactive elements.
- Help maintain smooth transitions and loading states.

### Repository Pattern Implementation

- Data access should flow one way: Repository → Server Load Function → Page Component.
- Never directly expose PRISMA schema objects to the client.
- Always transform database entities to viewmodels before returning from repositories.
- Use SvelteKit's server-only modules for repository implementations.
- Implement proper transaction handling for operations that modify multiple tables.
- Handle database errors gracefully with appropriate status codes and error messages.

## Implementation Examples

### Svelte 5 Component

```svelte
<script>
	import { ImageWithSkeleton } from '$lib/components/ui/image-with-skeleton';

	let count = $state(0);
	let doubledCount = $derived(count * 2);

	$effect(() => {
		console.log(`Count changed to ${count}`);
	});

	function incrementCount() {
		count++;
	}
</script>

<Button onclick={incrementCount}>
	Increment: {count} (doubled: {doubledCount})
</Button>

<ImageWithSkeleton
	src="/product-image.jpg"
	alt="Product display"
	className="w-full"
	aspectRatio="1/1"
/>
```

### Prisma Query Example

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export async function getProductWithVariants(productId: string) {
	try {
		const result = await prisma.product.findUnique({
			where: {
				id: productId
			},
			include: {
				variants: true,
				images: true
			}
		});

		return result;
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Database query failed:', error);
		throw new Error('Failed to fetch product');
	}
}
```

### Repository Pattern Example

```typescript
// src/lib/repositories/product-repository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import type { ProductViewModel, ProductVariantViewModel } from '../models/product';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export async function getProducts(): Promise<ProductViewModel[]> {
	try {
		const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
			include: {
				images: {
					take: 1
				}
			}
		});

		// Transform to viewmodel
		return products.map((p) => ({
			id: p.id,
			name: p.name,
			price: p.price,
			description: p.description,
			imageUrl: p.images[0]?.url || '/placeholder.jpg'
		}));
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Failed to get products:', error);
		throw new Error('Failed to retrieve products');
	}
}

export async function getProductById(id: string): Promise<ProductViewModel | null> {
	try {
		const result = await prisma.product.findUnique({
			where: {
				id: id
			},
			include: {
				variants: true,
				images: true
			}
		});

		if (!result) return null;

		// Transform to viewmodel
		return {
			id: result.id,
			name: result.name,
			price: result.price,
			description: result.description,
			images: result.images.map((img) => img.url),
			variants: result.variants.map((v) => ({
				id: v.id,
				name: v.name,
				price: v.price,
				stockQuantity: v.stockQuantity
			}))
		};
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(`Failed to get product ${id}:`, error);
		throw new Error('Failed to retrieve product details');
	}
}
```

### SvelteKit Load Function Example

```typescript
// src/routes/products/[id]/+page.server.ts
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { getProductById } from '$lib/repositories/product-repository';

export async function load({ params }) {
	const product = await getProductById(params.id);

	if (!product) {
		error(404, 'Product not found');
	}

	return {
		product
	};
}
```

### Internationalization Example

```svelte
<script>
	import * as m from '$lib/paraglide/messages/en.js';
</script>

<div class="product-card">
	<h3>{m.product_title()}</h3>
	<p>{m.product_price({ value: product.price })}</p>
	<span>{m.product_quantity()}</span>
	<Button>{m.product_add_to_cart()}</Button>
</div>
```
